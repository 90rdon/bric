== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What shortcodes are available? =

Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes makes available 6 shortcodes: [accordions], [accordion], [haccordions], [haccordion], [tabs] and [tab]. The plural tags (accordions, haccordions, tabs) are wrappers that define the group of tabs or accordions. The singular shortcodes (accordion, haccordion, tab) represent the individual content items within each group.

= How do I use the plugin? =

Full instructions can be found on the [Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes](http://squelchdesign.com/wordpress-plugin-squelch-tabs-accordions-shortcodes/) project home page on the Squelch Web Design website.

= Can I change the look of the widgets? =

Yes. The plugin creates jQuery UI accordions and tabs, and the horizontal accordions have been set up to use jQuery UI themes. So changing the jQuery UI theme in use on the page will change the appearance of the widgets. Currently the plugin does not provide its own mechanism for changing the jQuery UI theme (although this is planned) so to change the theme please install the excellent jQuery UI Widgets plugin. Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes plugin respects changes to the jQuery UI theme made by the jQuery UI Widgets plugin.

You can also style the widgets with your own custom CSS if you wish, but that is beyond the scope of this FAQ. Instructions will be made available on the [Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes](http://squelchdesign.com/wordpress-plugin-squelch-tabs-accordions-shortcodes/) project home page as soon as I find time to write a guide.

= I used to use TheThe Tabs and Accordions, is this plugin compatible? =

Mostly compatible, yes. The initial goal of the plugin was to provide compatibility with that plugin as a way for those who've been left stranded by the demise of TheThe Tabs and Accordions plugin to continue using their accordions, horizontal accordions and tabs. Currently there is no support for toggles though, this is planned but not yet available. I've changed some of the defaults for the widgets from what TheThe Tabs and Accordions used so if you've not been explicit when creating shortcodes you may notice some changes. I believe the defaults are better and more in line with what most people will want. Also, some minor functionality has still not been implemented so if you rely on those functions you might spot a few inconsistencies. Feel free to raise a support request on the plugin forum if functionality you require is missing.

= Is this a fork of TheThe Tabs and Accordions? =

No. This plugin has been written from the ground up as a new plugin that happens to be compatible with TheThe Tabs and Accordions. It provides a number of fixes to issues that were present in TheThe Tabs and Accordions, and even offers some new functionality.

= After installing the plugin I get a warning about a fix for TheThe Tabs and Accordions =

When TheThe Tabs and Accordions plugin stopped working I provided a temporary fix to help keep everyone's sites limping along. This fix was always intended to be temporary. If you receive the following message:

> Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes has detected that you are using a fix for TheThe Flyâ€™s Accordions and Tabs plugin that was made available by Squelch some time ago. The fix in question is NOT intended as a long-term solution and should be removed as soon as possible. By using Squelch Tabs and Accordions you do NOT need the fix. Please see this article for instructions on how to remove the fix from your website.

then you still have the fix enabled on your website. You will need to find the fix (look for function thethe_fix) and remove it. More information can be found on the [Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes](http://squelchdesign.com/wordpress-plugin-squelch-tabs-accordions-shortcodes/) project home page.

= Can I see a demo of the widgets? =

Sure, on the [Squelch Tabs and Accordions Shortcodes](http://squelchdesign.com/wordpress-plugin-squelch-tabs-accordions-shortcodes/) project home page.
